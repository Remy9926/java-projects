The way to input commands to the garden is in the form:

For PLANT:

PLANT COORDINATE PLANT_NAME

For PRINT:

PRINT

For GROW:

GROW NUM_TIMES COORDINATE/PLANT_NAME(optional)

For HARVEST, PICK, and CUT

H/P/C COORDINATE/TYPE(optional) 

Plant will always need the name of a plant such as "rose", "tomato", or "oak".

Print simply prints out the entire garden

Grow will by default grow every plant the specified number of times. If provided with a COORDINATE, grow will only grow that specific coordinate.
If provided with a Plant (Tree, Flower, Vegetable), grow will only grow plants of that specific class.

Harvest, pick, and cut work on vegetables, flowers, and trees, respectfully. If given a coordinate, the command will only work on the specified coordinate.
If given a name, the command will only work on plants in the garden of the specified name such as "rose", "tomato", or "oak".
